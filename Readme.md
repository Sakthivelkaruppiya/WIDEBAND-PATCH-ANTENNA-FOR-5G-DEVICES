Wideband Microstrip Patch Antenna for 5G Communication
Introduction

The demand for wideband and multi-band antennas has significantly increased with the advent of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications, where different frequency spectrums are allocated based on various standards. To address this demand, a straightforward patch antenna with a low profile and a relative bandwidth of 59.6% has been developed for mobile terminals in communication systems. This study focuses on a microstrip patch antenna operating at 38 GHz and models it for future 5G communication technologies.
Antenna Design
Substrate

The substrate used for this antenna is FR4-epoxy, with a dielectric constant (εᵣ) of 4.4 and a thickness of 1 mm. FR4-epoxy is a common material used in antenna design due to its favorable electrical properties and cost-effectiveness.
Software

The antenna is simulated using HFSS software, which is a convenient and widely-used tool for electromagnetic simulation and analysis.
Simulation Results

The simulation of the microstrip patch antenna yielded the following results:

    Return Loss: -36.8 dB
    Gain: 5 dB
    Radiation Efficiency: 56%
    Side-lobe Level: -18.3 dB

Comparison with Previous Works

The results obtained from the simulation of this proposed antenna surpass the performance of previously developed antennas in the field. Notably, the return loss is significantly improved, and the gain and radiation efficiency are also enhanced.
Potential for 5G Wireless Technology

Given the superior performance of this antenna and its wide bandwidth, it shows great promise for meeting the needs of 5G wireless communication systems. The high gain and radiation efficiency make it a capable candidate for mm-wave communications in 5G technology.
Conclusion

The wideband microstrip patch antenna operating at 38 GHz on an FR4-epoxy substrate has demonstrated excellent performance characteristics through simulation. Its remarkable return loss, gain, and radiation efficiency make it a strong contender for 5G wireless communication systems. The results obtained from this study exceed those of previous works, indicating its potential significance in the development of 5G technologies.
